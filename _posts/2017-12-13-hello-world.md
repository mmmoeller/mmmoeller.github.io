#**BIOGRAPHICALLY

I moved to flip the page when I stopped, eyes on the red ad in front of me. It was for Special K red berries cereal. As AP Lang taught me earlier that day, I trained my gaze on each element. Each detail, color, font, and image placement had a purpose and was a conscious symbolic decision. I knew from psychology that red is meant to induce hunger. The connections I made in that moment exponentially increased my appreciation for marketing, and I learned that my skills could be useful to change how we perceive textual arguments.

Freshman year of college, I was a Professional Writing major, aiming to follow the Editing track. It was unique to Miami and a draw that convinced me to enroll. Four years later, I graduated a triple major with a Bachelor of Arts in Psychology, Professional Writing, and Neuroscience.

Why neuroscience? Biological psychology is fascinating and there is so much yet to be discovered. And the introductory course was at once rigorous, relatable, and intensely entertaining. Entering this major, I aspired to enter into research to lessen the detrimental effects of dementia. I soon gained experience studying stress and mood disorders, sparking a life-long interest. I also had the opportunity to participate in a year-long behavioral neuroscience lab to inform our understanding of Dopamine's impact on cognitive abilities. The principal investigator intends to replicate my team's work with a larger sample to clarify an interaction we saw in males.

##**MUSICALLY

After I tried the clarinet and oboe, the music teacher handed me a flute. I could not make a sound. She told me I was a flute; whether for numbers or because of my proportionally-long arms, I do not know. I am thankful for that decision bringing me into the band community, where I made lifelong friendships bonding over "dance elements" which included lying on the parking lot in July.

Going to a university out of state, I decided to join the marching band. Through the experience of run-ons and rain delays, we became a family. I went on to watch my first hockey games playing in the pep band, which also brought energy to the volleyball and basketball stands. Years from now, I hope I can still play the fight song from memory.

Music is still a part of me now that I am not in an ensemble. It never ceases to brighten the mood of the house. Silence is overrated when you could instead listen to feel-good music and boost your endorphins.

##**Lawful Good Approach

Noted pragmatist, I asked for *Dreyer's English* for my 21st birthday.

I worked as a writing consultant for two years. We reviewed written works from all academic disciplines to address a writer's needs while teaching them to recognize patterns for future writing. While I had professional writing coursework identifying the elements of language, the real talent of consulting was in providing feedback in a way that maintained the writer's voice.

##**Personally**

Myers-Briggs classifies me as ISFJ. I care deeply, pouring my heart into purposeful work. Always thought of myself as a combination of Ravenclaw and Slytherin. However, my Hufflepuff friend declares themself Slytherin, so I believe we judge ourselves as we would like to be seen, not as we are. I prefer to think of myself as lawful good.
What informs my personality?
Without a doubt, my college experience has molded me into the person I am today. I became an advocate of teamwork, a dependable communicator, a loyal friend and family member. My band sorority provided service for the band, which was exactly the community of multi-faceted people I was honored to know. My role models became my friends and family members.

##**In Sum**

I am a triple major college graduate. My closest friends share a mutual interest in the art of music and the aesthetic qualities it projects to others. I continue to write and edit with purpose. I seek opportunities to share my English- and science-tailored writing and research skills with thoughtful companies and creators.

##**Projects**
###Professional Writing
Whether working on academic, extracurricular, or professional projects, I apply proven writing, critical thinking, and research skills. Experience in my professional courses has given me tools in Adobe InDesign, Illustrator, and Photoshop, and in my final semester I worked with HTML and CSS to produce an ebook version of The Scarlet Letter. I also have experience writing grant proposals both for research endeavors and to secure funding for projects. Some of the most enduring work I’ve contributed to includes marketing materials for Louie’s Legacy Animal Rescue and an informational brochure and <a href="http://www.historichopewellchurch.org/">website</a> for the Historic Hopewell Church.
###Biopsychology
In addition to my communications background, I have had the experience of formulating research in biology, neuroscience, and psychology courses. As a researcher in the BURP-BN program, I have been through the detailed process of developing a proposal and protocol, as well as running the experiment and creating poster presentations. I also have experience writing research grant proposals and APA-formatted research papers, which I have additional experience reviewing for Miami’s social science publication COMPASS.
